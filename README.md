Its about a sensor (gyroscope+accelerometer) connected to an Arduino Nano, which send the data through bluetooth to any Android device with the App and bluetooth activated and connected, to turn the movements into sound responses.

It uses Eclipse to create the Android app, uses Processing for the graphics and Puredata for the sounds. but today it should exists more easy ways to do the same.
